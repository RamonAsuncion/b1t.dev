# What is on my mind?

## Registration 
Shit ass registration. I have to wait 
until Monday November 3 to register while the juniors 
and seniors have extra days to register in between.
What I do not understand is why these mother fuckers are 
registers for classes like csci206. 


## Grades
I can not believe that even if I am not socializing anymore 
I am still not getting any success in my classes. I do not know 
what is up. Yes, I do get distracted sometimes and end up working 
on my side projects instead of doing homework, but at the end of the 
day I get it done. Everytime I open up academic progress I feel ashamed 
myself. How could I go from being a great student in high school to 
completely doing so poorly. What I hate most is classes in my major that 
I have received low grades in. I know people who did not even try or 
shown up to classes receive higher grades than me in some. I am a fuck up.


## Freetime
Even though I had more free time this semester since I am not taking 
any CS classes I feel like I wasted a semester in college.
Yes I am taking some cool ass classes but I just want to do CS man. 
I am trying to work on side projects to keep me moving and this 
"cs" music class is cool ass hell. I am just feeling like this semester
had little involvement to my major to pursuement to be exact since
none of the classes I am taking really add requirements fullments to CS.
